# WebSockets Serving
This example illustrates how to set up a WebSocket server and handle a connection.

## Initiating a WebSocket Session

In your `PerfectServerModuleInit` function, which all Perfect modules must have, enable URL routing by calling `Routing.Handler.registerGlobally()`. Then add one or more URL routes using the `Routing.Routes` subscript functions. These routes will be the endpoints for the WebSocket session. Set the route handler to `WebSocketHandler` and provide your custom closure which will return your own session handler.

The following code is taken from the example project and shows how to enable the system and add a WebSocket handler.

``` swift
public func PerfectServerModuleInit() {
	
	// Initialize the routing system
	Routing.Handler.registerGlobally()
	
	// Add a default route which lets us serve the static index.html file
	Routing.Routes["*"] = { _ in return StaticFileHandler() }
	
	// Add the endpoint for the WebSocket example system
	Routing.Routes["GET", "/echo"] = {
		_ in
		
		// To add a WebSocket service, set the handler to WebSocketHandler.
		// Provide your closure which will return your service handler.
		return WebSocketHandler(handlerProducer: {
			(request: WebRequest, protocols: [String]) -> WebSocketSessionHandler? in
			
			// Check to make sure the client is requesting our "echo" service.
			guard protocols.contains("echo") else {
				return nil
			}
			
			// Return our service handler.
			return EchoHandler()
		})
	}
}
```
## Handling WebSocket Sessions

 A WebSocket service handler must impliment the `WebSocketSessionHandler` protocol.
 This protocol requires the function `handleSession(request: WebRequest, socket: WebSocket)`.
 This function will be called once the WebSocket connection has been established,
 at which point it is safe to begin reading and writing messages.

 The initial `WebRequest` object which instigated the session is provided for reference.
 Messages are transmitted through the provided WebSocket object. 
 Call `WebSocket.sendStringMessage` or `WebSocket.sendBinaryMessage` to send data to the client.
 Call `WebSocket.readStringMessage` or `WebSocket.readBinaryMessage` to read data from the client.
 By default, reading will block indefinitely until a message arrives or a network error occurs.
 A read timeout can be set with `WebSocket.readTimeoutSeconds`.
 When the session is over call `WebSocket.close()`.


The example `EchoHandler` consists of the following.

``` swift
class EchoHandler: WebSocketSessionHandler {
	
	// The name of the super-protocol we implement.
	// This is optional, but it should match whatever the client-side WebSocket is initialized with.
	let socketProtocol: String? = "echo"
	
	// This function is called by the WebSocketHandler once the connection has been established.
	func handleSession(request: WebRequest, socket: WebSocket) {
		
		// Read a message from the client as a String.
		// Alternatively we could call `WebSocket.readBytesMessage` to get the data as a String.
		socket.readStringMessage {
			// This callback is provided:
			//	the received data
			//	the message's op-code
			//	a boolean indicating if the message is complete (as opposed to fragmented)
			string, op, fin in
			
			// The data parameter might be nil here if either a timeout or a network error, such as the client disconnecting, occurred.
			// By default there is no timeout.
			guard let string = string else {
				// This block will be executed if, for example, the browser window is closed.
				socket.close()
				return
			}
			
			// Print some information to the console for informational purposes.
			print("Read msg: \(string) op: \(op) fin: \(fin)")
			
			// Echo the data we received back to the client.
			// Pass true for final. This will usually be the case, but WebSockets has the concept of fragmented messages.
			// For example, if one were streaming a large file such as a video, one would pass false for final.
			// This indicates to the receiver that there is more data to come in subsequent messages but that all the data is part of the same logical message.
			// In such a scenario one would pass true for final only on the last bit of the video.
			socket.sendStringMessage(string, final: true) {
				
				// This callback is called once the message has been sent.
				// Recurse to read and echo new message.
				self.handleSession(request, socket: socket)
			}
		}
	}
}
```

## FastCGI Caveat
WebSockets serving is only supported with the stand-alone Perfect HTTP server. At this time, the WebSocket server does not operate with the Perfect FastCGI server.
