// A WebSocket service handler must impliment the `WebSocketSessionHandler` protocol.
// This protocol requires the function `handleSession(request: WebRequest, socket: WebSocket)`.
// This function will be called once the WebSocket connection has been established,
// at which point it is safe to begin reading and writing messages.
//
// The initial `WebRequest` object which instigated the session is provided for reference.
// Messages are transmitted through the provided `WebSocket` object.
// Call `WebSocket.sendStringMessage` or `WebSocket.sendBinaryMessage` to send data to the client.
// Call `WebSocket.readStringMessage` or `WebSocket.readBinaryMessage` to read data from the client.
// By default, reading will block indefinitely until a message arrives or a network error occurs.
// A read timeout can be set with `WebSocket.readTimeoutSeconds`.
// When the session is over call `WebSocket.close()`.
class EchoHandler: WebSocketSessionHandler {
	
	// The name of the super-protocol we implement.
	// This is optional, but it should match whatever the client-side WebSocket is initialized with.

	// This function is called by the WebSocketHandler once the connection has been established.
	func handleSession(request: WebRequest, socket: WebSocket) {

		// Alternatively we could call `WebSocket.readBytesMessage` to get binary data from the client.

			// This callback is provided:
			//	the received data
			//	the message's op-code
			//	a boolean indicating if the message is complete (as opposed to fragmented)
			string, op, fin in
			
			// The data parameter might be nil here if either a timeout or a network error, such as the client disconnecting, occurred.
			// By default there is no timeout.
			guard let string = string else {
				// This block will be executed if, for example, the browser window is closed.
				socket.close()

			// Print some information to the console for informational purposes.
			print("Read msg: \(string) op: \(op) fin: \(fin)")
			
			// Echo the data we received back to the client.
			// Pass true for final. This will usually be the case, but WebSockets has the concept of fragmented messages.
			// For example, if one were streaming a large file such as a video, one would pass false for final.
			// This indicates to the receiver that there is more data to come in subsequent messages but that all the data is part of the same logical message.
			// In such a scenario one would pass true for final only on the last bit of the video.
			socket.sendStringMessage(string, final: true) {
				
				// This callback is called once the message has been sent.
				// Recurse to read and echo new message.
