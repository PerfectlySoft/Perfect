## Perfect: Server-Side Swift

Perfect is a complete and powerful toolbox, framework, and application server for Linux, iOS, and macOS (OS X). It provides everything a Swift engineer needs for developing lightweight, maintainable, and scalable apps and other REST services entirely in the Swift programming language for both client-facing and server-side applications.

Perfect includes a suite of tools that will enhance your productivity as you use only one programming language to build your apps: Swift. The global development community’s most dynamic and popular server-side toolbox and framework available today, Perfect is the backbone for many live web applications and apps available on iTunes.

This guide is designed for developers at all levels of experience to get Perfect up and running quickly.

## More about Perfect

Perfect operates using either a standalone [HTTP server](https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/Perfect-HTTP), [HTTPS server](https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/Perfect-HTTPServer), or through [FastCGI server](https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/Perfect-FastCGI). It provides a system for loading your Swift-based modules at startup, for interfacing those modules with its request/response objects, or to the built-in [Mustache template processing system](https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/Perfect-Mustache).

Perfect is built on a completely asynchronous, high-performance networking engine to provide a scalable option for internet services. It supports Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption, and it features a suite of tools commonly required by internet servers such as [WebSockets](https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/Perfect-WebSockets) and [iOS push notifications](https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/Perfect-Notifications), but you are not limited to those options.
